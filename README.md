### Possible bugs:

Skype may not work

### How to

Run as administrator!  
During the program do not do anything. Reboot follow automatically.  
Do not pay attention to an error in the console - the way it should be, for example, the code can be written several times removing the same function in different ways to be sure.  

Some functions may not work or partially work not at all, the code is fairly crude. But it gives excellent results and save a lot of time. Programme of 2-5 minutes is enough to set up Windows 10 on the level of the programmer. Manually setting this would take several hours, even an experienced master.
